# GeoFS-addon-libraries

This is a repository of libraries and tools for constructing GeoFS addons. You can use these to help make addons or to implement functionality that you don't know how to do. You can also use these for reference. <br>
Example:
- getBearing function: used to find the bearing (in radians) between two LLA coordinates.
